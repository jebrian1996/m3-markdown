# Exercise-2

As described in [module-4](https://github.com/INFO-201/m4-git-intro), you should begin by forking this repository, then cloning it to your local machine (if you haven't already).

In the space below, you'll provide some information about a terminal command you've learned thus far in the class. In particular, you should include the following:

A `heading` with the name of the command
An example of how it can be used (with appropriate code highlighting)
A _nested list_ of information about the command (i.e., things that it does, or how it can be used)

See `complete` branch for answers.

#cd
The 'cd' command is used to move into different directory to search files.

'''
cd Desktop/Documents
'''

Here's some more information about the 'cd' command:

- It can be used to go up the directory using the '..' code
- You can go all the way up the directory using the '~' command'
